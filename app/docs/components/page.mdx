# Components

ConvexBooking includes ready-to-use React components for both the public booking flow and admin management.

## Booker

The `<Booker />` component is the main booking interface for your users. It handles the full booking flow: calendar display, time slot selection, form submission, and confirmation.

```tsx title="app/book/page.tsx"
import { Booker } from "@/components/booker/booker";

export default function BookingPage() {
  return (
    <Booker
      eventTypeId="studio-session"
      resourceId="studio-a"
      title="Book Studio A"
      description="Select a time for your session"
      onBookingComplete={(booking) => {
        console.log("Booking created:", booking);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### Booker Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `eventTypeId` | `string` | Yes | The event type to book |
| `resourceId` | `string` | Yes | The resource to book |
| `title` | `string` | No | Header title |
| `description` | `string` | No | Header description |
| `showHeader` | `boolean` | No | Show/hide header (default: true) |
| `organizerName` | `string` | No | Display name for the organizer |
| `organizerAvatar` | `string` | No | Avatar URL for the organizer |
| `onBookingComplete` | `(booking) => void` | No | Callback when booking succeeds |
| `onEventTypeReset` | `() => void` | No | Callback when user wants to change event type |

### Booker Flow

The Booker has three steps:

1. **Event Meta** - Calendar + time slot selection
   - Shows monthly calendar with availability dots
   - Displays time slots for the selected date
   - Handles duration selection (if multiple options)
   - Manages real-time presence (slot locking)

2. **Booking Form** - User details
   - Collects name and email
   - Optionally collects notes
   - Validates input before submission

3. **Success** - Confirmation
   - Shows booking details
   - Option to add to calendar
   - Back button to book another

## Calendar

The calendar component is used internally by Booker but can also be used standalone:

```tsx
import { Calendar } from "@/components/booking-calendar/calendar";

<Calendar
  resourceId="studio-a"
  eventTypeId="studio-session"
  duration={60}
  slotInterval={60}
  timezone="Europe/Berlin"
  onSlotSelect={({ slot, duration }) => {
    console.log("Selected:", slot, duration);
  }}
/>
```

The calendar includes:
- **Monthly grid** with availability dots
- **Time slots panel** for the selected date
- **Duration selector** (if event type has options)
- **Timezone selector**
- **Real-time presence** showing reserved slots

## Admin UI

The admin dashboard (`/admin`) provides a complete interface for managing your booking system.

### Resources Admin

Manage bookable resources at `/admin/resources`:

- Create new resources (rooms, equipment, people)
- Edit resource details and settings
- Activate/deactivate resources
- Set resource timezone

### Schedules Admin

Manage availability schedules at `/admin/schedules`:

- Create named schedules (e.g., "Business Hours", "Weekend Hours")
- Define weekly availability per day
- Set a default schedule
- Configure timezone

### Event Types Admin

Manage booking templates at `/admin/event-types`:

- Create event types with title and description
- Set duration and duration options
- Configure slot intervals
- Link to resources (which resources can this event be booked on)
- Set buffer times before/after bookings

### Bookings Admin

View and manage bookings at `/admin/bookings`:

- List all bookings with filters
- View booking details
- Cancel bookings
- See booking history

## Customization

All components use Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui primitives. To customize:

1. **Styles** - Modify component files directly or override with Tailwind classes
2. **Behavior** - Fork the component and modify the logic
3. **Fields** - Add custom fields to the booking form schema

Since you're working with the source code (not an npm package), you have full control over every aspect of the components.
