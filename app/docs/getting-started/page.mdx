# Quick Start

Get ConvexBooking running in your own Convex project in about 5 minutes.

<Callout type="info">
  There's no npm package yet. The current way to use ConvexBooking is to **fork the repository** and customize it for your needs.
</Callout>

## 1. Fork the Repository

Fork or clone the repository to get started:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourname/convex-booking my-booking-app
cd my-booking-app
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Set Up Convex

Run the Convex dev command. If you don't have a Convex project yet, it will prompt you to create one:

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will:
- Prompt you to log in to Convex (if needed)
- Create a new Convex project (or connect to an existing one)
- Generate a `.env.local` file with your Convex URL
- Start watching for changes

Keep this terminal running.

## 4. Start the Dev Server

In a new terminal, start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the landing page.

## 5. Explore the Demo

The project includes a complete demo setup:

- **Landing Page** (`/`) - Marketing page with features overview
- **Documentation** (`/docs`) - You're reading it!
- **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`) - Manage resources, schedules, event types, and bookings
- **Public Booking** (`/book`) - The booking flow your users will see

Try creating a resource and event type in the Admin, then book a slot in the public booking flow.

## Customize for Your Project

Once you have it running, you can customize:

1. **Remove what you don't need** - Delete the landing page, docs, or demo data
2. **Modify the Booker component** - Customize styles, add fields, change the flow
3. **Update the schema** - Add custom fields to bookings, resources, etc.
4. **Connect your auth** - Integrate with your existing authentication

### Stripping the Docs (Optional)

If you're using this as a starting point and don't need the documentation site:

```bash
# Remove docs-related files
rm -rf app/docs
rm -rf components/docs

# Remove landing page (optional)
rm app/page.tsx
rm -rf app/(marketing)  # if it exists
```

Then remove these dependencies from `package.json`:
- `@next/mdx`
- `rehype-pretty-code`
- `shiki`

Replace `next.config.mjs` with a simple config:

```javascript title="next.config.mjs"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};
export default nextConfig;
```

Finally, remove `--webpack` from your dev scripts in `package.json` to use Turbopack:

```json
"dev": "next dev",
```
